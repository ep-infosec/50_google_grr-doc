# Installing from a release deb (recommended)

This is the recommended way of running a fleetspeak based setup.

Starting from [v3.4.2.3](../release-notes.md#october-01-2020), the release deb contains a
bundled fleetspeak installation. To use it, proceed as described in

the installation of the package (or when running `grr_config_updater`) answer
the following question with `yes`:

```
Use Fleetspeak (next generation communication framework)?
