# Working with Hunt results

Hunt results in GRR work almost the same as Flow results. The only difference is that each item is annotated with the client id of the client that produced it. Everything else (filtering, exporting, generating archives with collected files) works exactly the same as with flow results as described in [the flow results section](../flows/working-with-results.md).
