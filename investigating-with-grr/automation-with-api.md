# Automation using the GRR API

GRR AdminUI server also serves as an API endpoint. We provide the *grr_api_client* Python library which can be used for easy GRR automation. See the [API client documentation](https://github.com/google/grr/tree/master/api_client/python) for more details.

There's also an [API client library in PowerShell](https://github.com/swisscom/PowerGRR) working on Windows, Linux and macOS for GRR automation and scripting, developed by Swisscom.
