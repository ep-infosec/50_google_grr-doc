# Collecting Artifacts

Artifacts can be collected using the artifact collector
[flow](../flows/starting.md). Multiple artifacts can be collected at once.

Using artifacts in hunts is particularly powerful as an artifact like
`JavaCacheFiles` can be scheduled in a single hunt across all three operating
systems, and the artifact itself determines the correct paths to be downloaded
for each operating system.
